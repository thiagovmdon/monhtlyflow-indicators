# monthly-flow-indicators-map

At this repsitory you may find a step-by-step about how to proceed with the calculations of monthly streamflow indicators computation considering natural versus modified conditions, considering both a tabular file, or but considering a Raster (PCRaster). 

The input are PCRasters of a study area considering each .map file as a different time-step. In this case the time-step used is monthly.
